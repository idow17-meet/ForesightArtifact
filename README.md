## Description
---------------------------
This mod adds the artifact of foresight which does the following:

- Displays the name of the item / equipment inside of a chest / barrel / lunar pod
- Displays the name in pings (might be too strong and changed to only work after initially seeing the item in the future :) )
- Raises the price of all chests / barrels / lunar pods / multishops by 50%
