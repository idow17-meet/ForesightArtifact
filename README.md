## Description
This mod adds the artifact of foresight which displays the name of a chest / equipment barrel / lunar pod's pickup in a hologram and in pings!  
The downside is that all of the above now cost more! (Configurable, defaults to 50% for balance)

## Recently Added
- Config file, allowing custom price changes, toggling the effect on lunar pods and pings!

## Install
- Unzip and place the dll in the plugin folder of Bepinex
- Enjoy :)


## Future Updates
Future updates might include even more config options / tweaks such as:
- Tweaking the behaviour of pinging to only show the pickup name after you've seen the hologram once,  
  so you'd be able to ping the chest for friends, but won't be able to ping from afar to check the chest!
